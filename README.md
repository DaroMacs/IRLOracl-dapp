## üîó IoT Integration Links

- [Local Server](https://github.com/DaroMacs/local-server-esp32): This server provides connectivity to from the IoT's devide to its IP and will be used to send the consumption or data to be recorded in the smart contract.

- [ESP32 Water Monitor Consumption Example](https://github.com/DaroMacs/ESP32-YF-S201): This program runs inside the ROM of the ESP32 which is connected to a flow water sensor that detects the quantity of water that flows in the device and then it is send to its local server(link above)

Flow sensor detection:
The serial monitor shows the water flow in liters, when water stops flowing it stops counting and the when flows again it measures as seen in this video:

- [ESP32 WIFI Connection](https://github.com/DaroMacs/ESP32WifiConnect): This program is to connect the ESP32 to the WIFI and send the data from the sensors via wireless.

Remark: The ESP32 can be customized to use any kind of sensors and therefore gather any kind of measurable IRL/Physical data.
